# An operator-registered OAuth application: the provider, the OAuth client
# (client_id + encrypted client_secret), and the scopes its consent flow
# requests.
#
# Each app has a globally-unique +slug+ that names its well-known consent links:
# a team member who knows the integration ("google") clicks
# /oauth/<slug>/start, consents, and lands on an centaur-console result page. The
# unauthenticated /oauth/:slug/start + /callback endpoints resolve an OauthApp by
# slug, run the provider's consent flow, and on success upsert a BrokerCredential
# linked back to this app (see BrokerCredential#oauth_app). The app is the
# durable config; its minted credentials are refreshed by the normal
# Broker::PollRefreshJob loop and delegate their client_id/client_secret back to
# the app, so rotating the app's secret fixes every credential it minted.
#
# Provider-generic by design: one model with a `provider` column and a small
# strategy registry (Oauth::Providers), not a table per provider.
