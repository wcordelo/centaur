    # iron-proxy polls this endpoint to fetch its config. It sends its current
    # config_hash; when that matches the freshly computed hash we return only the
    # hash (no payload), so the proxy skips re-applying. Otherwise we return the
    # full `secrets` and `transforms` payload.
    #
    # `secrets` populates the proxy's `secrets` transform. `transforms` carries
    # whole transforms the proxy splices into its pipeline: one gcp_auth,
    # gcp_id_token, hmac_sign, or aws_auth transform per granted secret, and one
    # bundled oauth_token transform. `postgres` carries one upstream-DSN
    # entry per granted PgDsnSecret, keyed by foreign_id; the proxy's
    # locally-defined listeners bind to these by foreign_id.
    #
    # The top-level `rules`, `mcp`, and `ingest_token` fields the proxy also
    # understands are intentionally omitted: centaur-console has no models for them
    # yet. Each secret still carries its own per-secret `rules`.
